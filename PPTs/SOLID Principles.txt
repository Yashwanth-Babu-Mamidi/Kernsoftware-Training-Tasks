## 🟦 Slide 1: Title Slide

**SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design**
---

## 🟦 Slide 2: Introduction to SOLID Principles

* SOLID is a set of **5 object-oriented design principles**
* Helps in writing:

  * Clean code
  * Maintainable software
  * Scalable applications
* Introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**

---

## 🟦 Slide 3: SOLID Acronym

* **S** – Single Responsibility Principle
* **O** – Open/Closed Principle
* **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle
* **I** – Interface Segregation Principle
* **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle

---

## 🟦 Slide 4: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Definition:

A class should have **only one reason to change**.

### Real-Life Example: Restaurant

* Chef → cooks food
* Waiter → serves food
* Cashier → handles billing

❌ One person doing all jobs
✅ Each person has **one responsibility**

### Benefit:

* Easy maintenance
* Better organization

---

## 🟦 Slide 5: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### Definition:

Software entities should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

### Real-Life Example: Mobile Phone

* New apps can be installed
* Phone OS remains unchanged

❌ Modifying OS for every new app
✅ Extend functionality without changing existing system

### Benefit:

* Reduces risk of bugs
* Improves flexibility

---

## 🟦 Slide 6: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### Definition:

Subclasses should be replaceable for their parent classes without affecting correctness.

### Real-Life Example: Birds

* Sparrow → can fly
* Crow → can fly
* Penguin → cannot fly

❌ Treating penguin as a flying bird
✅ Penguin should not replace flying birds

### Benefit:

* Correct use of inheritance
* Reliable behavior

---

## 🟦 Slide 7: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### Definition:

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

### Real-Life Example: Office Machines

* Printer → prints
* Scanner → scans
* Fax → faxes

❌ One machine forced to do everything
✅ Separate machines for separate tasks

### Benefit:

* Less complexity
* More flexibility

---

## 🟦 Slide 8: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Definition:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on **abstractions**.

### Real-Life Example: Electrical Switch

* Switch works with bulb, fan, or tube light
* Uses a standard socket

❌ Switch fixed to one bulb
✅ Switch depends on abstraction (device)

### Benefit:

* Loose coupling
* Easy replacement

---

## 🟦 Slide 9: Advantages of SOLID Principles

* Improved code quality
* Easy maintenance
* Better scalability
* Reduced code dependency
* Easier testing and debugging

---

## 🟦 Slide 10: Why SOLID is Important

* Used in real-world software development
* Helps teams collaborate efficiently
* Makes applications flexible to change
* Foundation of clean architecture

---

## 🟦 Slide 11: Summary Table

| Principle | Real-Life Meaning                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| SRP       | One person, one job                |
| OCP       | Add features without changing base |
| LSP       | Correct replacement of objects     |
| ISP       | No unnecessary responsibilities    |
| DIP       | Plug-and-play components           |

* Improve readability, maintainability, and flexibility
* Essential for professional developers
